"""The Mythos Cinematic Charter and shared parsing utilities.

The charter is the visual contract injected into every Mythos generation:
camera-as-narrator grammar, headlines before symbols, term zooms, captions,
and the Mythos palette. Everything in this module is dependency-free and
side-effect-free so the harness, service, API, and MCP server can all share
one source of truth.

CINEMATIC_CHARTER = """\
MYTHOS CINEMATIC CHARTER — the generated scene MUST obey all of it.

1. CAMERA IS THE NARRATOR. Use ThreeDScene with the top-down stage pattern:
   set_camera_orientation(phi=0, theta=-90*DEGREES) so the stage reads as 2D;
   tilt into 3D only for set pieces. Move the camera with
   self.move_camera(...) / set_camera_orientation(...); NEVER call .animate
   on self.camera, and never use add_fixed_in_frame_mobjects for formulas you
   intend to zoom into (keep those in world space).
2. HEADLINE BEFORE SYMBOLS. Introduce every major idea with a full-screen
   plain-language statement (font_size >= 64), hold it, fade it, THEN show
   the mathematics.
3. ZOOM INTO TERMS. When explaining part of a formula, dim the rest, color
   the part, and fly the camera into it (zoom 2x-3x via
   move_camera(frame_center=part.get_center(), zoom=...)). Pull back to
   zoom=1 afterward so the part is seen inside the whole.
4. CAPTION EVERYTHING. Every formula on screen gets a one-line plain-English
   lower-third caption (italic, font_size 28-32). Max ONE headline or TWO
   text blocks visible at once. Replace captions; never stack them.
5. PACING. self.wait(0.6-1.6) between beats. A viewer who knows no notation
   must be able to follow from captions and camera motion alone.
6. PALETTE. Default house palette: background #0c0c0b, text #faf9f5,
   accents coral #d97757 (matter), blue #6a9bcc (light/gauge), olive
   #788c5d (mass/structure), gold #d4a27f (interaction), gray #b0aea5
   (secondary). If the user prompt specifies a different art direction,
   background, paper stock, or ink system, that explicit direction wins:
   implement it consistently and choose readable text/geometry colors for it.
   Use color to give each symbol a consistent identity across the whole film.
7. CRAFT. Build formulas from multi-argument MathTex so terms are
   addressable; use glow layers (stroke copies) for emphasis; LaggedStart
   for ensembles; no external assets, file IO, or network. Manim CE 0.19+.
8. SHORT AND SUPPLEMENTARY, BY DEFAULT. This film accompanies a written
   first-principles text (a "knowledge atom") that already contains the
   full derivation, in prose, with citations and edge cases. The film's
   only job is showing the ONE spatial/visual mechanism the prose can't
   convey — not re-teaching the argument end to end. Treat the intent
   brief's duration_seconds as a hard ceiling, never a floor: when in
   doubt, cut a shot rather than add one, cut an act rather than add one,
   and end the instant the visual point has landed. This rule applies
   unless the user's own prompt explicitly asks for a longer, full
   cinematic piece.
