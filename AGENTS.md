# Agent guide

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository.

## What this repo is

Math-To-Manim contains provider-native silos. The established `mythos/` product
is the Anthropic-native six-agent chain driven by Claude Fable 5. The parallel
`sol/` product is a complete GPT-5.6 Sol-native film pipeline driven only by
the Codex CLI and its cached ChatGPT login. It does not use an API key, an HTTP
model endpoint, or Mythos orchestration.
Do not route one provider through the other provider's orchestration layer.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `sol/` | Independent GPT-5.6 Sol silo: Codex CLI driver, film contract, harness, validation, run ledger |
| `docs/SOL_5_6_SILO.md` | Sol architecture and deployment contract |
| `mythos/agents/mythos-visual-brief.md` | The single agent charter (single source of truth; mirror to `.claude/agents/` for native Claude Code use) |
| `mythos/harness.py` | Chain runner: visual-brief → codegen → verify → render → repair |
| `mythos/charter.py` | The Cinematic Charter + parsing utilities |
| `mythos/backends.py` | Model backends: Claude CLI (default), Codex CLI, OpenAI-compatible HTTP |
| `mythos/cinematography.py` | The visual grammar library scenes import |
| `mythos/service.py` | Job orchestration shared by all front doors |
| `mythos/api.py` | REST API (FastAPI) — `math-to-manim serve-api` |
| `mythos/mcp_server.py` | MCP server (FastMCP) — `math-to-manim serve-mcp` |
| `mythos/cli.py` | The `math-to-manim` command |
| `examples/mythos/` | Flagship hand-finished films (QFT, Sound of Spacetime) |
| `docs/showcase/` | Curated GIF gallery — the art-direction target |
| `tests/` | Offline test suite (no model calls, no render needed) |
| `archive/`, `legacy/` | Retired code. Do not import from it; do not "fix" it. |

## Working rules

1. **Runs are cheap, renders are not.** `--offline` exercises the whole chain
   deterministically with zero model calls; use it for plumbing changes.
2. **Charters are the product.** Behavior changes in the chain usually belong
   in `mythos/agents/*.md`, not in harness code.
3. **ThreeDScene camera rule:** `move_camera()` / `set_camera_orientation()`,
   never `.animate` on `self.camera`. The static verifier enforces this.
4. **Artifacts land in `runs/mythos/<ts>-<slug>/`** — keep them repo-local
   (never `/tmp`) so humans can inspect them.
5. **Tests must pass offline:** `pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest`.
6. **Keep the README's showcase GIFs and star chart intact** in any docs work.
7. **Keep provider silos native.** `sol/` must not import Mythos prompts,
   backends, or orchestration; `mythos/` must not import the Sol client.
8. **Sol is CLI-only.** Do not add an HTTP API, Responses API client, API-key
   fallback, or calculator-specific compiler to `sol/`.

## Quick verification

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                                        # 29 tests, offline
math-to-manim run "the heat equation" --offline
math-to-manim serve-api &  curl localhost:8642/health
math-to-manim-sol run "why Fourier modes solve the heat equation" --offline
math-to-manim-sol doctor
```
